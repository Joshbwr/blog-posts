MDX, a hybrid of Markdown and JSX, provides the simplicity of markdown combined with the power of React components.
Pairing MDX with an external repository introduces a smoother workflow. This enables you to add new posts without having to redeploy your site,
cutting down unnecessary time and effort. This post will outline the process, bringing together MDX files and an external repo to streamline your
blog development and maintenance.
<br />
This article presumes an existing familiarity with TypeScript and Next.js using the app router.
Your first task involves establishing a GitHub repository and generating a new personal access token.
Let's dive in: to kickstart this process, your initial steps should focus on configuring a GitHub repository.
This will serve as the external home for your MDX files. Simultaneously, you'll need to create a personal access token.
This token is a crucial element of the setup, providing the necessary permissions for seamless operations between your blog and the repository.
Below you will find the steps to create a new token.
<br />

- Navigate to your GitHub account settings.
- Click on the Developer Settings tab.
- Select Personal Access Tokens.
- Click Tokens (classic).
- Click Generate New Token (classic).

Be sure to save your token in a secure location. You will not be able to view it again after leaving the creation page.
<br />

Alright, now you have a token. Assuming you already have a repo setup with your nextjs boilerplate, let's get started.
I've created a new file called posts.ts inside of my lib directory. This file will be responsible for fetching our posts from our external repo.
Take a look at the code below and we will walk through it.

```tsx
import { compileMDX } from "next-mdx-remote/rsc";
import rehypeSlug from "rehype-slug";
import rehypeHighlight from "rehype-highlight/lib";
import rehypeAutolinkHeadings from "rehype-autolink-headings/lib";
import CustomImage from "@/components/shared/custom-image";

export const getPostByName = async (
  fileName: string
): Promise<BlogPost | undefined> => {
  const res = await fetch(
    `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Joshbwr/blog-posts/main/${fileName}`,
    {
      headers: {
        Accept: "application/vnd.github+json",
        Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN}`,
        "X-GitHub-Api-Version": "2022-11-28",
      },
    }
  );

  if (!res.ok) return undefined;

  const rawMDX = await res.text();
  if (rawMDX === "404: Not Found") return undefined;

  const { frontmatter, content } = await compileMDX<{
    title: string;
    date: string;
    tags: string[];
    description: string;
  }>({
    source: rawMDX,
    components: { CustomImage },
    options: {
      parseFrontmatter: true,
      mdxOptions: {
        rehypePlugins: [
          rehypeHighlight,
          rehypeSlug,
          [rehypeAutolinkHeadings, { behavior: "wrap" }],
        ],
      },
    },
  });

  // Get file name without extension
  const id = fileName.replace(/\.mdx$/, "");

  const blogPostObj: BlogPost = {
    meta: {
      id,
      title: frontmatter.title,
      date: frontmatter.date,
      tags: frontmatter.tags,
      description: frontmatter.description,
    },
    content,
  };
  return blogPostObj;
};

interface PostMetaProps {
  limit?: number;
}

export const getPostsMeta = async ({
  limit,
}: PostMetaProps): Promise<Meta[] | undefined> => {
  const res = await fetch(
    "https://api.github.com/repos/Joshbwr/blog-posts/git/trees/main?recursive=1",
    {
      headers: {
        Accept: "application/vnd.github+json",
        Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN}`,
        "X-GitHub-Api-Version": "2022-11-28",
      },
    }
  );

  if (!res.ok) return undefined;

  const repoFiletree: Filetree = await res.json();

  let filesArray = repoFiletree.tree
    .map((obj) => obj.path)
    .filter((path) => path.endsWith(".mdx"));

  const posts: Meta[] = [];

  if (limit) filesArray = filesArray.slice(0, limit);

  for (const file of filesArray) {
    const post = await getPostByName(file);
    if (post) {
      const { meta } = post;
      posts.push(meta);
    }
  }

  return posts.sort((a, b) => (a.date < b.date ? 1 : -1));
};
```
<br />

Lets start with getPostsMeta, this function will be responsible for fetching all of our mdx files from our external repo.
This basically works by fetching the file tree from our repo and filtering out any files that do not end with .mdx. 
On to getPostByName, this function will be responsible for fetching a single mdx file and parsing it's raw contents. We will use this function to fetch a single post when we need it. 
We iterate over each file returned from getPostsMeta and using the method compileMDX from next-mdx-remote we parse the raw contents of the file into a usable format.
You may notice the variable frontmatter being used here, this is the metadata that we will be using to populate our blog post. Frontmatter allows you
to define data that can be extracted. In this case we are defining the title, date, tags, and description of our blog post.
An example of this can be seen below.
