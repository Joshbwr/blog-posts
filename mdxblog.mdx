MDX, a hybrid of Markdown and JSX, provides the simplicity of markdown combined with the power of React components.
Pairing MDX with an external repository introduces a smoother workflow. This enables you to add new posts without having to redeploy your site,
cutting down unnecessary time and effort. This post will outline the process, bringing together MDX files and an external repo to streamline your
blog development and maintenance.

This token is a crucial element of the setup, providing the necessary permissions for seamless operations between your blog and the repository.
Below you will find where to find the token creation page.
